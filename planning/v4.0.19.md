Summoning overhaul patch:
Marks are now deterministic, and based entirely on tablet consumption. Consuming tablets in combat will now progress your mark level.
Since mark level is determined by tablet consumption, any mark can be trained with any style.
Summoning skill tree in ItA completely overhauled. Non-CO rewards (e.g. summoning mastery, product cost reductions) replaced with Combat boosts.
All abyssal familiar drop rates rebalanced. All are more common (30%-50% drop rate) and in cases where other items on the drop table were made less common, the quantities of important items were modified to keep the average gain per hour unchanged
Summoning skillcapes flat barrier damage values have been fixed
