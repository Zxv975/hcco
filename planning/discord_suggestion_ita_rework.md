TotH: Runestone, Carrion Longbow
ItA: Abyssium Platebody, Twisted Thorn (or Brumite Platelegs (U)), Gloomite Helmet+Gloom Resin (or Gloomite Helmet (U)), Brumite Crossbow.
I'd again also request Ancient Arcana (AoD) and Meteorite Staff (TotH) due to them being required for specific spells to be cast. In ItA all spells can be cast but there's some issues with obtaining Abyss Runes (and in fact a lot of Runes in general but Abyss you REALLY feel it since all spells need them). Certain spells require combination runes whilst many also cannot use combination runes with Gloom, Null, Umbral, and Scourge having absolutely no sources.
AoD: add bar dust upgrade
