Patch notes v1.0.0

# External mods

- The following mods have been natively incorporated into this release. They are compatible with existing versions, and as they will only affect HCCO and MCCO characters it is recommended to keep the other mods installed for other gamemodes.
  • Mini Max Capes (partially, only combat capes incorporated)
  • Slayer Reroll Fix
  • Repeat Current Slayer Task

# Miscellaneous changes

- All food now heals for a minimum of 1 (no more AE1 Arid Plains horror stories).
- An optional cap on bank space akin to hardcore mode has been added.
- The ability to repeat slayer tasks has been added. This comes with a -65% multiplicative slayer coin penalty. This should make farming slayer tasks for task requirements much less painful, but it won't be better slayer coin income than variety slayer.
- Resupplies and packs can now be purchased with limited bank space as long as the player has enough items already in their bank from the purchase. Previously the player needed to have every item or more than 5 bank spaces open, but now, for example, a pack can be bought with 1 empty bank space if the player owns 4 out of the 5 items given by the pack.
- Summoning has been added as an optional combat skill. Tablets cannot be created directly, but tablets have been added to various monster and dungeon drop tables. Marks still need to be obtained as a drop at least once before additional marks can be obtained. 
- If enabled, summoning now contributes to combat level in the same manner as prayer.
- If enabled, a summoning requirement has been added to the combat max cape and superior version.
- If summoning is enabled, the combat max cape now has a 10% chance to preserve summoning charges.
- If summoning is enabled, the combat superior max cape now has a 15% chance to preserve summoning charges.

# Nerfs

- Hitpoints is now capped at 99 until after 15,000 combined Dark Waters monster kills. This was done to respect the extremely well balanced state the CO gamemode was inadvertently in before the expansion, while still making IDE much easier to complete than pre-expansion. XP is still gained beyond 99 and the other combat skills are unaffected.
- The following nerfs have been applied to the following items. The reasoning is that their effect was frankly too strong and completely trivialised prayer as a resource. It was relatively balanced pre-expansion due to cape slot being highly contested, but as the effect can now be readily obtained through the combat max capes it was simply too strong to leave unchanged.
  • The prayer skillcape and combat max skillcape now reduce prayer point costs by 25%, down from 50%. 
  • The superior prayer skillcape and combat superior max skillcape now reduces prayer point costs by 35%, down from 75%.

# Drop table adjustments

- Several monsters have had their drop tables rebalanced. The overall goal was to make magic much less painful by making the rune gathering process easier, and to add sources of familiars for the summoning skill. This is still being balanced and will be revisited in future if necessary.

  • Magic chest: air, water, earth and fire now have a minimum of 400 and maximum of 800, up from 1 and 100 respectively.
